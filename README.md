# How do NASA Contracts relate to the locations of NASA centers and Congressional Budget committee assignments? 

Establishing Shot (infographic? unclear).

* This section will contain a basic overview of the entire story. 
  * [NASA PDV](https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgibin/npdv/map.cgi)
* This page should take between 5-15 minutes to ingest.
* Intended audience:
  * Nerdy teenager who is very interested in space, though not necessarily policy.
  * The above teenagers parents, who may be scientists, academics, educators, or similar fields, but likely not directly working in space.
  * 25-40 year old military member who has slightly more vested interest, but space is still a hobby.
  * Young adult with enthusiasm for space who is just learning the complexity of the policy side. 

## Outline

This section will contain an outline of what is to come. I might not include this. 


## Brief Overview of NASA 

This will contain information discussing each NASA center, including when it was established and what it primarily does (if easily described)


## Congressional Budgeting

A brief overview of the congressional budget process.

#### NASA budget committees
Connect the general overview of the process to the specific committes relevant to NASA.


## Data Sources

This story uses NASA procurment data and historical data about who sits on which committee.  

#### NASA Data
Part of this will be modified text about the NASA contracts from previous assignements. This will include a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the data. 

#### Congressional Committee Data  
This will be a description of how the author obtained and cleaned the committee data. I will likely need to manually find this information.

## Start of Story

A transition from the above discussion to the actual data presentation. 

#### Choropleth map 
I need to fix this so that the map is interactive.

#### NASA Centers
Let's zoom in on just the states that contain NASA centers.

#### Committee Membership  
Now let's look at where committee members are from.  

(Committee Map - maybe a graphic using the setup of the house/senate floors)

## Drill-down: California.
This section will examine the congressional districts in CA as they relate to the locations of the 3 NASA centers in CA.  

## Relationships between variables
The parallel coordinate diagram below contains the top variables and allows the viewer to check the relationship between certain variables.   

(This will contain a brushed parallel coordinate plot)
