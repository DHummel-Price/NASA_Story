# How do NASA Contracts relate to the locations of NASA centers and Congressional Budget committee assignments? 

This section will contain a basic overview of the entire story. 


## Outline

This section will contain an outline of what is to come. I might not include this. 


## Brief Overview of NASA 

This will contain information discussing each NASA center, including when it was established and what it primarily does (if easily described)


## Congressional Budgeting

A brief overview of the congressional budget process.

#### NASA budget committees

Connect the general overview of the process to the specific committes relevant to NASA.


## Data Sources

A description of data used here. 

#### NASA Data
Part of this will be modified text about the NASA contracts from previous assignements. 

#### Congressional Committee Data
The other parts will be a description of how the author obtained and cleaned the committee data.

## Start of Story

A transition from the above discussion to the actual data presentation. 

#### Choropleth map 
I need to fix this so that the map is interactive.

## Project Origination and Acknowledgements 

This project originally was developed for the Data Vizualization course as part of the author's Master of Science in Data Science for Public Policy degree program at the McCourt School for Public Policy at Georgetown University. The project would not be possible without the guidance of Taylor Corbett (<link to Taylor's page here>) and the other students in the course: Jean Landry Binam Keyanfe, Lixue Chen, Chandler Dawson, Zachary Gozlan, Eric LaRose, Yining Li, Ziqi Niu, Madeline Pickens, Andrea Cristina Quevedo Acuna, George Schoeffel, Harsh Sharda, Neha Tiwari, and Lily Yue.
